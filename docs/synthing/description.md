# Synthing

Synthing is an Android music sketchpad with a continuous arrangement timeline, dual synth voices, chord grids, scale-aware keyboards, and a piano-roll editor backed by a native low-latency Oboe engine.

## Features

- Continuous infinite-arrangement timeline with arrangement-wide loop IN/OUT markers
- Dual Synth A / Synth B subtractive engines with presets, modulators, LFO, and FX
- Play tab chord pads, scale-aware keys, and isomorphic grids with performance toggles
- Piano-roll editor with touchpads, snap/quantize, automation lanes, and note links
- Content-fitted bird's-eye overview strip for fast timeline navigation (viewport lens; tap/drag moves the view, not the playhead)
- Play-tab header mini-map for playhead scrubbing and punch-in recording
- DAW-style recording from any piano-roll playhead position, with pre-roll, live note display, dynamic synth arming, and two-stage Stop/return-to-start behavior
- Project manager with sections, clip launcher slots, templates, and JSON import/export
- Reliable background auto-save for arrangement and piano-roll notes, chord/arp assignments, note filters, Synth A/B parameters, and Play/Synth/Roll workspace state
- Crash-safe atomic project and synth files with a final save flush when the app pauses

## Platforms

- Android API 24+ (arm64-v8a / armeabi-v7a / x86 / x86_64)
- Projects and settings stored locally on device as JSON
- No account or network connection required
