Holistic personal tracking for food, supplements, exercise, measurements, lifestyle, and notes — with an adaptive calorie engine, AI logging and coaching, reminders, cloud sync, and offline support.

bettertracking is a full journal + library system, not a simple calorie counter. Track what you eat and do, build a personal library of ingredients and combos, stage batches into your journal, and let targets adapt from your weight trend and activity.

## New in 1.2.0

- Personalized food suggestions based on current intake, goals, dietary preferences and your library
- Optional web research with cited sources
- Nutrition reports with filters, rankings, food frequency, charts and CSV export, all without AI
- Create and edit library entries from text or labels with reviewed drafts and evidence labels

## Features

- **Six domains** in one place: Food, Supplement, Exercise, Measurement, Lifestyle, and Note
- **Journal** with day/week/month views, domain filters, tag search, trend charts, and multi-select export (CSV / Markdown / clipboard)
- **Personal library** of reusable ingredients and combos with macros, micros, custom fields, exercise routines, and attached reminders
- **Staging tray** for multi-item logging with quantities, units, voice quick-add (uses each library item’s defined unit), and day-target awareness
- **Library panel** remembers search, scroll, and expanded groups across tray switches
- **Quick Log**: free text and/or a photo → AI-estimated macros, refine with feedback
- **Adaptive nutrition engine**: Mifflin–St Jeor BMR, weight-trend adaptation after ~14 days, conservative 0.8× trust on exercise burn, manual overrides
- **Optional Energy Bank** that carries surplus/deficit across days with lookback, recovery, and pacing controls
- **AI assistant & coaching**: tool-using chat (navigate, query logs, create/update items, set reminders), plus local day/week/month Health Coach prompts that open in the user's selected chatbot (Perplexity by default)
- **AI Architect**: describe an item (optionally with images) and let the model draft the library entry
- **Speech-to-text** via Groq Whisper (default) or OpenAI Whisper, plus on-device voice capture on Android
- **Alerts & reminders**: per-item schedules (daily/weekly/monthly/etc.), wake/sleep alarms, Capacitor local notifications with reboot rescheduling
- **Firebase Auth + Firestore** account sync with IndexedDB offline persistence
- **Library JSON export/import** including combo dependencies

## AI unlock

In-app AI features (Quick Log, AI Architect, chat, and voice transcription) are enabled through the RykerSoft App Manager: have bettertracking access granted to your RykerSoft account, then sign in with that account inside the app under **Profile → API Keys → RykerSoft AI unlock**. Health Coach prompts do not use BetterTracking API credits; the external chatbot uses the user's own account. All tracking, journaling, library, and reminder features work without the unlock. You can also supply your own Gemini/Groq/OpenAI keys manually.
