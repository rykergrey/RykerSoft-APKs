Holistic personal tracking for food, supplements, exercise, measurements, lifestyle, and notes — with an adaptive calorie engine, AI logging and coaching, reminders, cloud sync, and offline support.

bettertracking is a full journal + library system, not a simple calorie counter. Track what you eat and do, build a personal library of ingredients and combos, stage batches into your journal, and let targets adapt from your weight trend and activity.

## New in 1.7.0

- Add mobile tap glows, independent light trails to the tray, and arrival pulses
- Show persistent tray selection checks across multiple library items, including combos
- Long-press selects and expands without duplicating items; cancel holds safely during scrolling
- Add visual feedback to navigation and library controls, with reduced-motion support
- Remove vibration from library, tray navigation, and number-pad interactions

## Features

- **Six domains** in one place: Food, Supplement, Exercise, Measurement, Lifestyle, and Note
- **Journal** with day/week/month views, domain filters, tag search, trend charts, and multi-select export (CSV / Markdown / clipboard)
- **Personal library** of reusable ingredients and combos with macros, micros, custom fields, exercise routines, and attached reminders
- **Staging tray** for multi-item logging with quantities, units, voice quick-add (uses each library item’s defined unit), and day-target awareness
- **Library panel** remembers search, scroll, and expanded groups across tray switches
- **Quick Log**: free text and/or a photo → AI-estimated macros, refine with feedback
- **Adaptive nutrition engine**: Mifflin–St Jeor BMR, weight-trend adaptation after ~14 days, conservative 0.8× trust on exercise burn, manual overrides
- **Rolling Calorie Balance** that compares recent intake with combined goals, explains logging coverage, and supports opt-in adjustments
- **Rolling nutrient progress** with daily and period views, goal-type-aware boundaries, cumulative variance, and individual overage-day counts
- **AI assistant & coaching**: tool-using chat (navigate, query logs, create/update items, set reminders), plus local day/week/month Health Coach prompts that open in the user's selected chatbot (Perplexity by default)
- **AI Architect**: describe an item (optionally with images) and let the model draft the library entry
- **Speech-to-text** via Groq Whisper (default) or OpenAI Whisper, plus on-device voice capture on Android
- **Alerts & reminders**: per-item schedules (daily/weekly/monthly/etc.), wake/sleep alarms, Capacitor local notifications with reboot rescheduling
- **Firebase Auth + Firestore** account sync with IndexedDB offline persistence
- **Library JSON export/import** including combo dependencies

## PRO Features

Items marked * require app-specific RykerSoft pro access for your signed-in account when using app-provided AI credentials. Sign in with the same RykerSoft account under Profile → API Keys.

* **Library Draft Assistant** — Read food and supplement labels, search exact manufacturer products, and refine partial drafts with photos or typed details
* **AI chat and Quick Log** — Tool-assisted chat and food analysis
* **Cloud transcription** — Dictate using configured speech providers

## AI unlock

In-app AI features (Quick Log, AI Architect, chat, and voice transcription) are enabled through the RykerSoft App Manager: have bettertracking access granted to your RykerSoft account, then sign in with that account inside the app under **Profile → API Keys → RykerSoft AI unlock**. Health Coach prompts do not use BetterTracking API credits; the external chatbot uses the user's own account. All tracking, journaling, library, and reminder features work without the unlock. You can also supply your own Gemini/Groq/OpenAI keys manually.
