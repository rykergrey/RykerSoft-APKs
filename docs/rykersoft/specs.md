## Permissions and Android APIs

- `INTERNET` for registry, documentation, screenshots, and APK downloads
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` for installed-version discovery across the managed catalog

- `LauncherApps` and `UserManager` for detecting visible copies in related profiles
- `FileProvider` for the legacy installer fallback

## Architecture

- Single-activity Compose application with lifecycle-aware state flows
- Android clipboard integration for copying per-app registry APK URLs
- Display-only Windows availability derived from verified registry `exeUrl` metadata and the known SuperThink.ing desktop edition
- Room database for the synchronized managed-app registry
- Repository layer for registry synchronization and dynamic Markdown documentation
- OkHttp streaming downloads with progress reporting from public, anonymously accessible release assets
- Pre-install package, signing-certificate, and downgrade validation
- PackageInstaller status receiver plus a dedicated confirmation activity
- Firebase Authentication and Firestore for RykerSoft account entitlements
- Android Credential Manager and Firebase Google Auth for the standard account flow
- UID-preserving Google credential linking plus migration-only email/password recovery
- Administrator-managed, package-scoped Firestore entitlements keyed by the preserved Firebase UID
- WorkManager-compatible background update scheduling

## Distribution and Security

- App Manager APKs are published on the public `rykergrey/RykerSoft` release page.
- RykerSoft Application Manager has no Windows release target; Windows badges never download or launch desktop binaries from Android.
- Other RykerSoft APKs and documentation are distributed through a clean public binary repository; application source repositories may remain private.
- Gallery screenshots are public assets under `rykergrey/RykerSoft/screenshots/`.
- Firebase project `rykersoft-abe84` registers the release certificate SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints for Google sign-in.
- Firestore clients may read only their own entitlement document and cannot create, change, or delete entitlements. Grants and revocations are trusted administrator operations that merge exact package-ID fields without replacing existing access.
- Public registry, documentation, APK, and EXE requests never include a long-lived GitHub token. The repository's GitHub Actions workflow performs secretless tests and debug-build validation; signed releases are built locally and verified before publication.
- Android requires an uninstall before installing v1.1.1 or newer over the debug-signed v1.1.0 release; uninstalling clears local app data.
